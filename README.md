# Learning Reinforcement Learning


Repository contains implementations of algorithms and selected programming exercises described in [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](http://www.incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html) by Richard Sutton &amp; Andrew Barto, 2018

## Structure
- [RL environmets](./rl_experiments/envs) includes basic testing environments (Open AI gym integration is on the way)
- [Multi-page dashboard](./rl_experiments/apps) each file contains layout and callbacks of a particular page
- [Standalone experiments](./rl_experiments/scripts) 


## How to use:
`git clone https://github.com/konichuvak/rl_experiments.git`

`python rl_experiments/index.py` launches a local [Dash](https://plot.ly/products/dash/) instance, allowing for interactive interpretation and exploration of presented solutions
